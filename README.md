# Hey Nate! Welcome to my README. 

This is my most recent project where the goal was to code a portfolio  centered around universal-adaption and a user-friendly experience.

The website has a costume made scrollbar, a design easy on the eye, a tab resposive navigation method for those without mousepad and a responsive design regulated for most screensizes.

There are a few webbrowser releated issues, but I have concluded that Chrome is the best one, so use that. 

The only bug is the footer placement on my first "fifa card project". It is not placed at the bottom when initially entering the website, but when inspecting element, it works. 

I have added comments mainly in my main index.css/html/js code that explains the "complicated" parts of the code. 

I have just now realised 00.55 wednesday that I have to link all my img, so here we go:(
